<h1 id='Game'>Baseball, The Game.</h1>
    
<p id='Played'>Baseball is a game where you use a small ball with laces on the sides that give it different spin.  The goal is to move runner around the bases and score runs.  The way to do this is to hit the ball, get runners on base, steal bases, and cross home plate.  Pitchers and fielders jobs are to stop the runners from advancing bases, by fielding ground balls, catching fly balls, and striking batters out.  Pitchers can manipulte the way a baseball moves by adjusting their grip and arm motion, making the ball curve, slide, cut, drift, and drop off and around the plate.  In the end, the team with the most runs after Nine innings wins.  if two teams tie, they play "extra innings".  Extra innings are innings teams keeps playing until one team scores a run, and holds the other team from scoring enough to tie/win the game.</p>
    
<h2 id= 'Pitching'>Pitching</h2>
    
<p id='Pitchers'>Pitchers have one of the toughest jobs on the field.  Their job is to keeps batter from hitting the ball.  They do this by keeping the batters of balance by throwing different pitches, like Fastballs, Curve balls, Changeups, And Sliders.  The way to throw these different Pitches is to change the grip on the ball, and change the way the arm moves in order to make the ball spin in a certain way.  Some grips, like the Four-Seam Fastball grip, are easy to throw and require no different arm motion, but some grips like the Curve ball, require a different grip and much different arm motion.  But the reason pitchers do this and risk arm injury is because lots of these pitches are very hard to hit, like the curve ball, which moves diagonaly depending on what hand the pitcher uses, but the fastball only moves straight, but it is faster then the rest of the pitches</p>
    
<h3 id='Batting'>Batting</h3>
    
<p id='Stances'>Batting is one of the hardest things to do in baseball, and if you aren't very good at it, you dont get very far in baseball.  Batters have to be ready to hit any pitch, and be able to guess which one is coming next.  A good batting stance helps hitting the ball farther, and with more power.  Examples of good batting stances are Kris Bryant, Manny Machado, Bryce Harper, Mike Trout, Alex Rodriguez, and Jose Bautista.  They all vary in batting stances from a wide even one, too a wide open one, too a shorter open one, too a short even one. and each one is good for different people.</p>
